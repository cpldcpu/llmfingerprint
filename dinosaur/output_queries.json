This large theropod dinosaur had a relatively short but powerful tail, a massive skull, and large, retractile leg muscles. It was considered as one of the largest and most fearsome predators during its time. The choice of this dinosaur is subjective and there are several other fascinating dinosaur species, but the Tyrannosaurus is one of the most commonly recognized and universally appealing.",
